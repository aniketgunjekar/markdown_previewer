To publish the user site, follow the below steps.

Create an Account in GitHub.
Create Repo in GitHub where the repo name should be username.github.io
Create React Application.
Deploy the React Application using GitHub Pages.
Commit and Push the codebase (React Application) into GitHub repo.

Step 1 - Create an Account in GitHub

Open the GitHub link
Create an account using your personal email
To secure your GitHub account, you can enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) login for your account.
Step 2 - Create Repo in GitHub

Login to your GitHub account.
Create the new repo by clicking the "+" icon at the right top of the page.


Enter the repo name as yourusername.github.io and choose whether the repo should be public or private.


Click on the "Create repository" button.
Now your repo has been created.
Step 3 - Create React Application

Create the react application which you want to host as a website. In this article, I am mainly focusing on how to deploy the react application on GitHub Pages. So please refer to this link to create React application.

Step 4 - Deploy the React Application

To deploy the application, follow the below steps.

1) Add GitHub Pages dependency package

Install "gh-pages" package using the below command.

npm install gh-pages â€” save-dev
Makefile
2) Add homepage property to package.json file

Add the below property to your package.json file.
For a GitHub user site: 
"homepage": "https://{username}.github.io"
For a custom domain: 
"homepage": "https://testwebsite.com"


3) Add deploy scripts to package.json file

Add both predeploy and deploy property scripts to the package.json file as below,

"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
Makefile
  The "predeploy" command is used to bundle the react application and the "deploy" command helps to deploy the bundled file.



4) Create a remote GitHub repository

Initialize the Git using "git init" command.
Add it as remote using "git remote add origin your-github-repository-url.git" command.
5) Deploy the Application to GitHub Pages

Now run the below command to deploy your react application to GitHub Pages.

npm run deploy
Makefile
6) Access deployed site

To get the published URL, 

Go to your GitHub Repo.
Click Settings menu.


Go to the "Pages" Section.


You can see the "Your site is published" message.
Select branch to "gh-pages" and click on the "Save" button.


Now, you can access the deployed site using the published URL!

Step 5 - Commit and Push the codebase

Commit and push your code changes to the GitHub repo. It is an optional one. But, for maintaining the code base we can do this step.

git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master
